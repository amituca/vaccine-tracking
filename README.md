# vaccine-tracking

The aim of this project is to develop an open source (and free as in free beer) solution to track the deployment in the global supply chain. Blockchain is a good starting candidate to achieve this vision while respecting some fundamental principles:

- Data privacy & Security is key. No one single private entity or government controls the entire data.
- The software is free & open source for the general community.
- Information is reliably stored and publicly accessible.
- The solution is scalable at a global level.
- It is easy to use & deploy
- It is fun for the developers, challenging and pushing the boundaries of what has been done so far.

For all the contributors, I dare to say that it is in the spirit of all of us today to make an active contribution to the current world situation and you have taken a step by contributing with your expertise towards this. You are part of the few who dare to make an improvement with the help of technology for the greater good of the society.
